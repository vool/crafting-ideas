<h1 align="center"> Idea üí°</h1>

Ideas can change the world. Although a lot of people put too much value into them. Ideas without implementation are nothing. Projects like [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) do an amazing job at helping an idea grow up and become a thing.


Some ideas don't need a kickstarter though. I want to create a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en), [about.me](about.me) like service that would allow users to showcase what ideas they have.

It would allow users to create a profile and then add their ideas. By default all ideas written down are private to the user but he can mark certain ideas as public and they will show up on his public profile.

Other people can then take a look at the profiles and see what ideas they think are interesting and ask how they can help and thus ideas actully have more chance at becoming a 'thing'.

Here is one such idea. This idea is nothing though until someone actually builds and makes it a 'thing'. This platform should minimse the time that it takes from getting a raw idea out into the world and seeing it grow.

<h1 align="center"> Implementation</h1>

I want to create a working MVP as soon as possible. Since this platform is essentially a social network for sharing and building on ideas together, it needs traction to actually be of any use. If there are no people, there is no value in the product. 

I will try to create a mock prototype with React and [create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and then iterate on that adding backend and database as I go.

<h1 align="center"> Build it üöÄ </a></h1>

To run it locally, clone the project and run

```
npm install

npm start
```

And then connect to http://localhost:3000

If you want to help, there is an [active slack group](https://join.slack.com/crafting-ideas/shared_invite/MjAwMzQ3MDY1NjY5LTE0OTc5MTg3ODUtYmIwYTg4MTkwMA) that you can join.


<h1 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas/issues"> Possible Features ‚ú®</a></h1>

There is a list of [open issues](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas/issues) you can take a look at. Choose any that you think are interesting or add your own. 


  <h1 align="center"> Help üíö</h1>

I hope I am not alone in wanting to build this and other people will join me in this. 

I have created a [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/crafting-ideas/shared_invite/MjAwMzQ3MDY1NjY5LTE0OTc5MTg3ODUtYmIwYTg4MTkwMA) that you can join if you wish to work together with me on this.
